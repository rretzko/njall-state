                                Many hands make easy work, but can also make many errors.  Names get misspelled, schools
                                get misaligned, non-English titles get mangled.  If you find an error,

                                As you page through the years, especially in the earliest years, you'll notice that we're
                                missing information.  Go through those boxes you have in your cellar, attic and storage
                                lockers.  Yours, your parents, even your grandparents!  If you find an old program,
                                album, cassette, or CD that can help fill out this collection, WOW! would that be an
                                enormous help!
